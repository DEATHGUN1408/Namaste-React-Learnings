cross-site scripting
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts into a trusted website. These scripts can steal sensitive information or modify web content. Prevention involves proper validation and sanitization of user input.
but js engine basically prevents us from this attack injection data
JSX, used in React, automatically escapes inserted expressions, converting potentially harmful characters into their literal representations. This prevents those values from being interpreted as code, thus helping to protect against XSS attacks.
